While compiling, it's possible you got an error from CryptoLib or CryptoPP or something like this.

To fix this:

Enter on data/out/built/x64-Release/vcpkg-installed/x64-windows/lib

Replace Cryptopp-static.lib with the new one on the folder.

Enter on data/out/build/x64-Release/vcpkg-installed/x64-windows/debug/lib

Replace Crytpopp-static.lib with the new one on the folder.

Close The Folder.

Open Visual Studio and compile.


This will work on Windows only.
I Cannot Help on Linux since i don't manage this OS.
If anyone manage it and can fix this, also can compile this version v6 on linux,
It would be great to contact us as we can upload it for everyone as linux version.
